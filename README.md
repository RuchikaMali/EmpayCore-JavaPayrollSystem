# 🖥️ EmpayCore: Employee Payroll System using Java OOP & Swing

Welcome to **EmpayCore**, a feature-rich **Employee Payroll System** built in **Java**! This project showcases how to implement core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles along with a **Java Swing-based GUI frontend** for enhanced user interaction.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- **Java Swing UI**: A simple and intuitive graphical interface using Java Swing for employee data input and salary display.
- **Abstract `Employee` class**: Serves as the foundation for different employee types.
- **Concrete subclasses**:  
  - `FullTimeEmployee`  
  - `PartTimeEmployee`  
  Each includes specific logic for salary calculation.
- **OOP Principles Demonstrated**:  
  ✔️ Inheritance  
  ✔️ Encapsulation  
  ✔️ Abstraction  
  ✔️ Polymorphism
- **Modular Structure**: Cleanly separated logic and UI components for better maintainability.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Great for learners exploring OOP and GUI programming in Java.
